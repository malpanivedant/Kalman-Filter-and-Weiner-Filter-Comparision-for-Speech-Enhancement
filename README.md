# Kalman-Filter-and-Weiner-Filter-Comparision-for-Speech-Enhancement
Mean-square-error comparison between Kalman and Weiner Filter to determine better process for Speech Enhancement.


Speech enhancement has been a hot research area in recent years with the fast development
of multimedia communications and other application. The presence of background noise in
speech significantly reduces the intelligibility of speech. Noise reduction or speech
enhancement algorithms are used to suppress such background noise and improve the
perceptual quality and intelligibility of speech. Removing various types of noise is difficult
due to the random nature of the noise and the inherent complexities of the speech. Noise
reduction techniques usually have a trade-off between the amount of noise removal and
speech distortions introduced due to processing of the speech signal. Several techniques have
been proposed for this purpose in the area of speech Enhancement, like spectral subtraction
approach, wiener filter, Kalman filter, weighted filter. The performance of these techniques
depends on the quality and intelligibility of the processed speech signal. The improvement in
the speech signal to noise ratio is the target of most techniques.
